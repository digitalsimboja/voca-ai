## Slide 2: The Problem
### Customer Service is Broken for Small Businesses

**$75B+ market** with massive inefficiencies:

- **Microfinance Banks**: 60% of customer queries are repetitive (balance checks, loan status)
- **Online Retailers**: 40% of support tickets are order tracking and returns
- **Current Solutions**: Expensive, complex, require technical expertise
- **Small Business Reality**: Can't afford $5,000+/month for enterprise solutions

**The Gap**: No affordable, easy-to-deploy AI solution that works across all channels (voice, WhatsApp, Instagram, SMS)

---

## Slide 3: Our Solution
### One-Click AI Agent Deployment Across All Channels

**Voca AI** is an AWS-powered platform that creates intelligent AI agents in minutes:

✅ **Voice & SMS**: Amazon Connect integration  
✅ **Social Media**: WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter  
✅ **Multilingual**: Supports 50+ languages  
✅ **Industry-Specific**: Pre-built templates for microfinance & e-commerce  
✅ **No-Code Setup**: Business owners deploy in 5 minutes  

**Result**: 24/7 customer service that costs 90% less than human agents

---

## Slide 4: Product Demo
### How It Works

**Step 1**: Business owner creates account  
**Step 2**: Selects industry template (Microfinance/E-commerce)  
**Step 3**: Customizes agent personality and knowledge base  
**Step 4**: Deploys across chosen channels  
**Step 5**: AI agent handles customer inquiries automatically  

**Live Demo**: Show agent handling:
- Voice call: "What's my loan balance?"
- WhatsApp: "Track my order #12345"
- Instagram: "Do you have queen-size comforters?"

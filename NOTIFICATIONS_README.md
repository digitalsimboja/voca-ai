# Voca AI Notifications Feature

## Overview

The notifications feature has been successfully implemented and integrated into the Voca AI application. The test page has been removed and replaced with a proper notifications page that follows the same pattern as other protected routes in the application.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Notifications Page (`/notifications`)
- **Protected Route**: Follows the same authentication pattern as other pages
- **MainLayout Integration**: Uses the same layout structure as dashboard, settings, etc.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Real-time Updates**: Polls for new notifications every 30 seconds

### 2. Key Components
- **Stats Cards**: Display total, unread, read, and archived notification counts
- **Filtering**: Filter notifications by status (all, unread, read, archived)
- **Actions**: Mark all as read, refresh, and individual notification actions
- **Notification List**: Shows recent notifications with proper styling and icons
- **Modal View**: Full notification management modal for detailed view

### 3. Backend Integration
- **API Service**: Uses the existing `apiService.ts` utility functions
- **Next.js API Routes**: Proxies requests to the notification service API running on port 8014
- **Authentication**: Proper JWT token handling with credentials included
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic polling for unread count updates

```

## API Endpoints

The notifications page connects to the following backend endpoints:

These routes proxy to the backend notification service running on port 8014.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
The application uses the following environment variables:

```bash
NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8014  # Backend notification service URL
```

### Backend Services
The notification service runs on port 8014 and requires:
- PostgreSQL database (port 5432)
- JWT authentication service
- Proper CORS configuration

## Usage

### Accessing Notifications
1. Navigate to `/notifications` in the application
2. The page is protected and requires authentication
3. Notifications are automatically loaded on page load
4. Use filters to view specific notification types
5. Click "View All" to open the full notification modal

### Notification Actions
- **Mark as Read**: Click the checkmark icon on unread notifications
- **Delete**: Click the trash icon to archive/delete notifications
- **Mark All Read**: Use the "Mark All Read" button to mark all as read
- **Refresh**: Click the refresh button to manually reload notifications

### Filtering
- **All**: Show all notifications
- **Unread**: Show only unread notifications
- **Read**: Show only read notifications
- **Archived**: Show only archived notifications

## Development

### Starting the Application
1. Start the backend services:
   ```bash
   cd bojalabs/vocaai-backend
   docker-compose --profile notification up -d
   ```

2. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd bojalabs/voca-ai
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

### Testing
- Navigate to `/notifications` to test the feature
- Check that notifications load properly
- Test filtering and actions
- Verify real-time updates work

## Integration Points

### Sidebar Navigation
The notifications page is now integrated into the main sidebar navigation with a bell icon.

### Authentication
The page uses the same authentication system as other protected routes.

### Layout Consistency
The page follows the same design patterns and layout structure as other pages in the application.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the notifications feature:

1. **Real-time WebSocket**: Replace polling with WebSocket for instant updates
2. **Push Notifications**: Browser push notifications for new notifications
3. **Email Notifications**: Email integration for important notifications
4. **Custom Filters**: More advanced filtering options
5. **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple notifications for bulk operations
6. **Notification Preferences**: User-configurable notification settings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Notifications not loading**: Check if the backend service is running on port 8014
2. **Authentication errors**: Verify JWT token is properly set
3. **CORS errors**: Ensure backend CORS is configured for localhost:3000
4. **Database connection**: Check if PostgreSQL is running and accessible

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API endpoints are accessible
3. Check authentication token in localStorage
4. Verify backend service logs

## Problem Statement

### The Customer Service Crisis for SMBs

**Microfinance Institutions**:
- 60% of customer queries are repetitive (balance checks, loan status, payment confirmations)
- Limited operating hours (8 AM - 5 PM) in markets where customers need 24/7 access
- High cost of human agents ($2,000-5,000/month per agent)
- Language barriers in multilingual markets (English, Igbo, Yoruba, Hausa)

**E-commerce/Online Retailers**:
- 40% of support tickets are order tracking and returns
- Social media customer service is manual and time-consuming
- No unified system across WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, SMS
- High customer acquisition costs due to poor service experience

**Current Solutions Fail SMBs**:
- **Enterprise solutions** (Zendesk, Intercom): $5,000+/month, complex setup
- **Custom development**: $50,000+ upfront, 6+ months development time
- **Human agents**: Expensive, limited hours, inconsistent quality
- **No AI-first solutions** designed for SMBs in emerging markets
